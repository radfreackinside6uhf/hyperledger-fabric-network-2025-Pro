## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of the difference between **permissioned blockchains** (like Hyperledger Fabric) and **public blockchains** (like those underlying major exchanges).

First, it's crucial to understand that **Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) does not replace or directly interact with the trading engines of Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken on their native blockchains.** Instead, an HLF network acts as a **secure, private, and authoritative coordination layer** that sits *alongside* these exchanges. It uses their **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) to execute trades and manage funds, while using the HLF blockchain as a single source of truth for the business logic and shared state among participants.

Think of it as a **high-security command and control center** that sends orders to various field agents (the exchanges).
